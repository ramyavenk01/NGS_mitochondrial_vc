# NGS_mitochondrial_vc
Mitochondrial Variant Calling Project using Bowtie2, SAMtools, Picard, GATK, and IGV
file contents are:
SRR30758927_trimmed.fastq:
Purpose: This is the trimmed FASTQ file containing the NGS reads used for alignment.

NC_012920.1.fasta:
Purpose: The reference genome of the human mitochondrial genome, used for alignment and variant calling.

aligned_reads_bowtie2.sam:
Purpose: SAM file containing the reads aligned to the reference genome, generated by Bowtie2.

aligned_reads_bowtie2.bam:
Purpose: BAM file created by converting the SAM file to BAM format using SAMtools for easier manipulation.

sorted_reads_bowtie2.bam:
Purpose: Sorted BAM file generated by sorting the aligned reads for further processing and analysis.

sorted_reads_bowtie2.bam.bai:
Purpose: Index file for the sorted BAM file, generated by SAMtools for fast access to the data.

sorted_reads_bowtie2_rg.bam:
Purpose: BAM file with added read group information, which is required for GATK to process the reads properly.

sorted_reads_bowtie2_rg.bam.bai:
Purpose: Index file for the BAM file with read group information.

output_variants.vcf:
Purpose: VCF file containing the variants called by GATK HaplotypeCaller.

filtered_variants.vcf:
Purpose: VCF file containing the filtered high-quality variants after applying GATK VariantFiltration.

Mitochondrial_Variant_Calling_Full_Report.docx:
Purpose: The full and detailed Word document report containing all the steps, results, discussion, and conclusions of the project.
